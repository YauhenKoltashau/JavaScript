// 10. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
// Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).
const myDesimal = 5.7

// 11. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
// Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.
const myDecimal = 5.0 * 1.0

// 12. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
// Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.
// const quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line
const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0

// 13. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
// Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.
const remainder = 11 % 3

// 14. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.
let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
// 15. Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction 
// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

// 16. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
 //17. Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
// 18. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
